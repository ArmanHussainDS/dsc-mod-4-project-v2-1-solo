# Module 4 Final Project - Solo Version

## Introduction

The project is focused on Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks. 

In this project I will be identifying the likelihood of a patient having pneumonia by investigating x-ray images provided from a Kaggle Dataset 

## The Project Context

The images for this project are obtainable from Kaggle from the following link: 

https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

The project was completed by producing 3 models, of which one of those models had its hyperparameters refined.

This was done to find the best result across the 3 models.

## Repository Contents 
The findings from this project are viewable in the Jupyter Notebook labelled Pneumonia.ipynb

A presentation was carried out and is listed as PneumoniaPresentation.pdf

The relevant data used where necessary are in the Data folder.
